estr (event string)

text encoding format used in events.  converted to fstr for rendering
superset of ascii, but otherwise doesn't seem to have correspond well
also has some not character options, ie element symbols
are the element symbols f commands??
sometimes 0x8041 (SJIS space) is used as space.  IS uses command for space

fstr (font string)
font is in syscg
starting at 5.gim, 0xPPYX maps to (5+P).gim and then X/Y.  each character is 16x16
F0 is seemingly 48.gim, others may or may not work
there's also a second copy of the first page + two rows of the second that's "narrower".  it's used for some UI elements

font roughly follows SJIS
however there are some peculiarities. 
page 0 (5.gim) has a "15" as a single character, used for platter/lucky ice cream buff
several greek letters have been replaced with card suits.  they were mysteriously moved to 9.gim and reordered???
page 3 (8.gim) has some characters used in tatsuyas scenario.  there's a small routine that remaps random characters to these.  whoever did this either didn't know about the estr2fstr table or wasn't allowed to modify it for some reason, so this was their solution to get the characters they need.
characters used for replacement
覧廃翌苺晴編損仙桃卵崖粉陣剤鎮幣
升鈴懸鐘猛募漢叱芝諭撮契棄熱昇絆
孝林寺粋贈位牡
page 4 (9.gim) diverges a bit.  the greek letters were relocated here.  some added characters which seem to be mostly chinese or otherwise very rare
another music note is also inserted here
page 21 (26.gim) 葹 is replaced with °??
the last page starting on the 3rd row has the ba gua, plus several more chinese characters

there is also an internal fstr to utf8 table, but it doesn't 100% match

technically all the syscg files are accessible in this manner
the icons are accessible using a font map style encoding at page 0x2b. 
the icons use less horizontal space this way versus the commands
the narrow font is also accessible dirctly at 26, but it's impossible to address the last two rows and it's not variable width
