PSP Archive or par
uint32_t num_entries
then that many
uint32_t len;

header is padded to 16 bytes.  first file starts at ((num_entries+1)*4+0xf)&~0xf
files are aligned to 16 bytes

last file is seemingly always "PSPCHECK\r\n"  this is where I derived the PSP Archive name from

event archive or ear
used by event.bin and a few other files
files seem to be sector aligned (2048)
header consists of array of
{
    uint32_t start;
    uint32_t end;
}
end is almost always identical to start of the next entry (ie sector aligned)
sectors are zero padded
must count to find number of files


BNP: see bnp.txt

Texture Archive or txar
uint32_t num_entries
then that many 
uint32_t off;
each file starts at that offset and runs to the next
each pair of files is a pxl/clt

sear
similar to ear except duplicate entries are removed
