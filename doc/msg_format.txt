message format used to represent text with commands

message_title:

message title, followed by single colon and then newline marks the start of the message
name may or may not be significant
in event script, names must used appropriately in the script, but are otherwise insignificant
string table names include the index, very important
newlines and whitespace are included.  newline is automatically converted to corresponding [nl]
messages must be terminated by [end]
one or more newlines allowed between messages

any text between messages that do not end with : are ignored, can be used for comments
might be worth adding or enforcing some comment character, possible #?

commands
[cmd]
[cmd(with, args)]

arbitrary binary data can be added with an escape: \x0000
must be 16 bits hex

if you need '[' in text, it must be escaped.  ie type \[
for the same reason, if you need \ escape as \\

'\ ' maps to the [pxl] command, ie 1 pixel space.  it's technically a character, but use it sparingly as it's "expensive"

a tab does not currently map to [tab] because it's not supported in the font encoding.  maybe it should be added?

not all commands are always available, there's like 12 different render functions and they don't all implement everything, just fyi

carriage return is ignored, ensure you at least have a newline
